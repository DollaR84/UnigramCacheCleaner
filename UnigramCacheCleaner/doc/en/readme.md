this addon clears unigram cache.
In the settings you can specify two paths for cleaning.
By default, the paths are set for the unigram cache from the store, and for the beta version of unigram.
You can also set your own custom path for cleaning.

Attention!
When setting your path, be careful, as the addon will delete all files from it!
